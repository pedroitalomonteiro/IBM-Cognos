When working with transactional data in IBM Cognos, its often necessary to identify the first recorded date for each CPF/CNPJ. A practical way to achieve this is by using the 'rank()' function with ascending order.


Example formula:

        rank ([data] ASC for [Documento])


What this formula does:

* Applies the 'rank()' function to the date field.
* The 'ASC' keyword ensures the earliest date receives rank 1.
* The ranking is partitioned by CPF/CNPJ, meaning it restarts for each individual.


How to use it:

1. Create a calculated field using the formula above.
2. Filter the results where the rank equals 1.
3. This will return the **first chronological record** for each CPF/CNPJ (for exemple).



This approach is especially useful when aggregation functions like 'min()' are restricted in grouped queries or complex datasets in Cognos.
