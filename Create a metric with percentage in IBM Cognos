## Now, this is how we create a metric with percentage in IBM Cognos. We use TOTAL because, like I said before, IBM Cognos has some specificities... in this case, it doesn't have a SUM operator. 

TOTAL (
    CASE
        WHEN Ouvidoria_ACM_txt.Tipo_de_Atendimento = 'Outros'
        THEN 1
        ELSE 0
    END
) / TOTAL (
    CASE
        WHEN Ouvidoria_ACM_txt.Tipo_de_Atendimento <> 'Pato amarelo'
        THEN 1
        ELSE 0
    END
)
